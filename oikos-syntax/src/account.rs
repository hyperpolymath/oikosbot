//! Stock and flow account declarations.

//! A **stock** is a quantity measured at a point in time (e.g. bank deposits).
//! A **flow** is a quantity measured over a period (e.g. wages, taxes).
//! The two types are distinct: adding a stock to a flow without an explicit
//! integration step is a type error.  This mirrors the physical distinction
//! between a reservoir (stock) and a pipe (flow).
