//! Financial instrument declarations with typestate.
//!
//! A financial instrument (invoice, bond, loan, etc.) progresses through a
//! well-defined sequence of states during its lifecycle.  Oikos encodes this
//! as a typestate machine that desugars to Ephapax typestate.
//!
//! Invalid state transitions are rejected at compile time: a `Void` invoice
//! cannot be settled; a `Settled` bond cannot become `Issued` again.
//!
//! Default lifecycle for an `Invoice`:
//!
//! ```text
//! Draft → Issued → PartiallyPaid → Settled
//!                                ↘ Void
//!       ↘ Void
//! ```
