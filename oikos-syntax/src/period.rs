//! Fiscal period declarations.
//!
//! A fiscal period is the Oikos analogue of a Tofte–Talpin region in Ephapax.
//! Values created within a period are scoped to it; moving a value across a
//! period boundary requires an explicit `close` operation that transfers
//! ownership and records the end-of-period balance.
//!
//! This enforces the SFC discipline that stocks are measured at period-end
//! and flows are measured over the period: you cannot mix values from
//! different periods without making the temporal arithmetic explicit.
