//! Expressions: transfers, FX conversions, and period closures.
//!
//! The central expression in Oikos is the **transfer**: a linear move of
//! monetary value from one account to another.  Linearity is enforced by the
//! Ephapax type system: after a transfer the source account's value is
//! consumed at the type level, making double-counting structurally impossible.
//!
//! FX conversions are explicit: you cannot transfer GBP from a GBP account
//! into a USD account without naming a dated exchange rate.
//!
//! Period closures carry a stock value across a period boundary.
